A Project of Data Science and Machine Learning Course. 


The dataset can be obtained from https://www.cpsc.gov/Research--Statistics/NEISS-Injury-Data/

To run the code for this project, one would need to install the latest version of python (can be found from https://www.python.org/downloads/) After python is installed, one would need to use the command line “pip” installer to install pandas, numpy, bokeh, Jupyter, and ipywidgets. Documentation on the pip installer can be found from: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/
